1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering
     DevOps is a way of working that combines development and operations to deliver software faster, more reliably, and with automation.  
     Cloud Engineering focuses on using cloud platforms like AWS to host, scale, and manage applications instead of traditional servers.

2. Why I Am Learning DevOps & Cloud
    I am learning DevOps and Cloud to:
  - Build strong practical skills beyond theory
  - Understand how real-world applications are deployed
  - Increase my chances of getting an entry-level DevOps / Cloud role
  - Become confident working with production systems

3. Where I Want to Reach in 90 Days
    By the end of 90 days, I want to:
    - Be comfortable using Linux and Git
    - Build and run applications using Docker
    - Understand CI/CD pipelines and automation
    - Deploy a basic application on AWS and Kubernetes
    - Be ready for internships or junior DevOps roles

4. How I Will Stay Consistent Every Day
   - Study at a fixed time daily
   - Focus more on hands-on practice than theory
   - Maintain notes and push work to GitHub
   - Track daily progress
   - Stay consistent even if progress feels slow

5. My Current Level: student  
   
6. My 3 Clear Goals for the Next 90 Days
